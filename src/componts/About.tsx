              Hey there! I'm a recent graduate from SVU, class of 2024, based in
              the lively city of Hamilton, Ontario.
              <p>
                I'm a software enthusiast who loves creating attractive websites
                that look great and work well.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not busy coding, you'll often find me enjoying my
              hobbies. I like to stay updated on the newest technologies and
              read whenever I can.
            </p>
            <p>
              Away from the computer, I try out new recipes, and explore
              different restaurants in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have big dreams for the future. I believe in setting high goals
              and working hard to achieve them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Come along with me as I pursue excellence and chase after my
              dreams, one line of code at a time.
            </p>
